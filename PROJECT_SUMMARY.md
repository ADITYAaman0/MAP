## Evaluation Metrics Explained

### Mean Average Precision @ 3 (MAP@3)
The competition uses MAP@3 as the primary evaluation metric:

**Formula**:
```
MAP@3 = (1/U) × Σ(u=1 to U) × (1/min(n,3)) × Σ(k=1 to min(n,3)) × P(k) × rel(k)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Meaning**: Average precision considering top 3 predictions
- **Advantage**: Rewards models that rank correct answers higher
- **Our Results**: 
  - Basic Model: 0.7213 (excellent)
  - Lightweight Model: 0.5356 (good)

### Validation Accuracy
Standard classification accuracy for the top prediction:
- **Basic Model**: Not directly measured (focus on MAP@3)
- **Lightweight Model**: 40.45% (reasonable for 65-class problem)

## Key Technical Insights

### 1. Class Imbalance Handling
- **Challenge**: Highly imbalanced dataset (40% True_Correct vs 0.62% False_Correct)
- **Solution**: Used appropriate loss functions and evaluation metrics
- **Impact**: Models tend to predict common classes more frequently

### 2. Text Preprocessing Strategies
- **Mathematical Notation**: Preserved LaTeX and mathematical symbols
- **Cleaning**: Balanced approach to maintain semantic meaning
- **Tokenization**: Different strategies for different models

### 3. Model Selection Considerations
- **Resource Constraints**: CPU-only training limited model complexity
