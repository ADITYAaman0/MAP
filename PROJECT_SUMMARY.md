MAP@3 = (1/U) × Σ(u=1 to U) × (1/min(n,3)) × Σ(k=1 to min(n,3)) × P(k) × rel(k)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Meaning**: Average precision considering top 3 predictions
- **Advantage**: Rewards models that rank correct answers higher
- **Our Results**: 
  - Basic Model: 0.7213 (excellent)
  - Lightweight Model: 0.5356 (good)
